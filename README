1. ABOUT
Tales of Solgonya will be a fantasy turn based tactical RPG taking part in Liberated Pixel Cup (see http://lpc.opengameart.org)

2. LICENSING
All code and .cfg files are released under GPL v3.0 license (see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).

Most of the image files inside folder data\images are taken from wulax's LPC entry (http://opengameart.org/forumtopic/progress-pic-thread-show-us-what-youre-working-on?page=3); the tilesets sand and sand+water were made by daneeklu (http://opengameart.org/forumtopic/progress-pic-thread-show-us-what-youre-working-on?page=2); the other images come from LPC base assets; all this stuff should be licensed under GNU GPL, as described by LPC rules, though I don't know if authors want to have additional licenses.

3. RUNNING THE GAME
WINDOWS USERS: just download https://sourceforge.net/projects/talesofgydia/files/latest/download?source=files, extract archive and launch test.exe

LINUX USERS: [upcoming...]

NOTE:
The game has not been tested (yet) on any OS apart from Windows XP (my fault, sorry :)) but as far as I know should be running on Ubuntu, Windows Vista and Seven (hopefully...)

Enjoy!
