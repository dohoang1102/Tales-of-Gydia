---Tales of Solgonya repository---

1. ABOUT
Tales of Solgonya will be a fantasy action-RPG taking part in Liberated Pixel Cup (see http://lpc.opengameart.org)

2. LICENSING
All code and .cfg files are released under GPL v3.0 license (see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).

At the moment, all image files are taken from base assets of Liberated Pixel Cup (see http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/assets.html), except file data/images/units/baseMale_thrust.png, which is taken from http://opengameart.org/forumtopic/progress-pic-thread-show-us-what-youre-working-on?page=1 and was made by wulax (wulax@opengameart: http://opengameart.org/users/wulax); since no license is provided (yet) for that file, it is not intended to be used anywhere else.

3. FILE INFO
Source files are in repository root. I know that code might be a little messy and unclear somewhere, but I haven't found time yet to sort it a little bit :) By the way, I tried to put comments wherever I could (and sorry if they aren't in correct English - that's not my native language...)

Data folder contains images, fonts (actually just one) and content files (under data\cfg). Content files are written in a small, name-less scripting language of mine - I promise I'll write a tutorial about it some day...

4. BUILDING
Just build the test.cpp source file - it includes all the headers and runs map described in data\cfg\db.cfg with three randomly placed units and another controlled by player. You need to link to libraries SDLmain, SDL, SDL_image and SDL_ttf (and of course you need to have their headers in the include directory of your compiler). Program has to run with several DLLs, which should be no problem if running on Linux but have to be downloaded on Windows, and are:
  - libfreetype-6.dll
  - libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
  - libpng12-0.dll
  - libstdc++-6.dll
  - SDL.dll
  - SDL_image.dll
  - SDL_ttf.dll
  - zlib1.dll

The file imgCFG.cpp runs a small command-line utility to generate a .cfg file from a spritesheet, describing all frames of the sheet in the unnamed script language of above.

The game has not been tested on any OS apart from Windows XP (my fault, sorry :)) but as far as I know should be running on Ubuntu, Windows Vista and Seven (hopefully...)

Enjoy!
